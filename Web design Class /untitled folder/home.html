<p1>Dear Hiring Management,</p1></br>

<p1><q>Information technology and business are becoming inextricably interwoven. 
I don't think anybody can talk meaningfully about one without the 
talking about the other</q></br>-Bill Gates. </br></p1>

    <p1>    Now more than ever computers are becoming an intricate part of society. We live in an age that's more wondrous than the Victorian Era and that's potentially as dangerous as the Wild West; that would be the Information Age. 
    Communication, and the sharing of technology has significantly benefited 
    the business sector of government. However, technological advancement has 
    one major drawback, the lack of education of these tools can leave a person 
    privacy completely vulnerable. I want to know as much as I can, to protect 
    myself and others.</p1></br>
    
    <p1>    Most people just don't aren't aware how vulnerable they are.By definition hacking means
    , use of a computer to gain access to data to a system. 
    When I say the words hacking or hackers, the average person just imagines
     someone in a dark room, typing rapidly away at their keyboard. Not the person
      who guessed someone password was,123456, which is the most common password used 
      according to surveys and most people should know this. At an early age I learnt the basics 
      and the necessities of keeping myself safe. I think cyber security is needed now and helping 
      someone stay safe and protecting people's privacy is needed. </p1></br>
    
    <p1>    As an undergraduate student of Molloy College, I hope to get
     my bachelors in, information systems, in order to pursuit the information 
     security field. The reason as to why I want to obtain this degree, is because
      I personally find the idea of being in a career that's constantly evolving, 
      to be extremely exciting. The computer science and information system fields, are
       probably the one of the best stable career to go into without investment 
       in monogamy of the same type of work. This I believe would put best use of
        my multitasking and ability to to learn quickly that I developed in school. </p1>


</br>
  <p1>Sincerely,</p1> </br>   
  <p1>Jerel Gates</p1></br>
